The project we worked on is “Integrating advanced sensor technologies for comprehensive terrestrial and aquatic care: Monitoring temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and water transparency while employing automated watering systems and water level testing for plant growth ”. In this project, we automated the watering system for a garden or crop field. We used a humidity & temperature sensor (DHT11), a soil moisture sensor and a relay module for controlling the dc motor. We also used a gas sensor for sensing the presence of poisonous gas and we also integrated a color sensor to check the transparency of the water to declare if the water is pure or impure. Moreover, we check the water level using a sonar sensor. Our project also counts the temperature of the soil and the humidity near the soil. Then it counts the moisture of the soil. If the moisture is less than 30 and the humidity is greater than 60 then the dc water pump turns on and waters the soil. Otherwise, the pump stays off.
